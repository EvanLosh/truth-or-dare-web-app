// App.js

// Copilot input: Create a React component called App that routes between components called NewGame, GameBoard, HowToPlay, and Pools. When App mounts, it should fetch truths and dares from a json-server and save them in states. App needs a state for the game's ruleset and a callback function to update the ruleset. The initial ruleset is {players: [], canSkip: true, canReroll: true, rerolls: 3, repeat: true, random: true, truthPool: "all", darePool: "all"}. Pass the ruleset and update function as props to NewGame. Elements of truths and dares have boolean properties called likedByUser and dislikedByUser. Create callback functions to set these properties to the opposite of what they are. Create callback functions to increment the skipCount and rerollCount of elements of truths and dares. Pass all states and callback functions as props to GameBoard. Pass the truths and dares states and the like and dislike functions as props to Pools. Style everything with bootstrap.

// Copilot was overwhelmed by our instructions and underdelivered. The result is woefully incomplete and not perfectly consistent with our input.

// Everything below this line was written by Copilot.
